An INNER JOIN is the result of an AND operation between the collections
There's also LEFT and RIGHT OUTER JOINS.
A FULL OUTER JOIN includes everything that is not the inner join

MANY-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP
	The elements of both collections can be linked 
		to one or more elements of the other collection

ONE-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP
	Only one collection can have elements linked to many
		elements of the other collection
	The elements of the single-link collection are normalized 
		if their count equals the linking collection count,
		because each single-link element appears only once
