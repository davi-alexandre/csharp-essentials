	Do return a collection instance with no items. In so doing, you avoid forcing the
caller to check for null before iterating over the items in the collection.
			For example, given a zero-size IEnumerable<T> collection, the caller can
		immediately and safely use a foreach loop over the collection without concern
		that the generated call to GetEnumerator() will throw a NullReferenceException.
			Consider using the Enumerable.Empty<T>() method to easily generate an
		empty collection of a given type.

	One of the few times to deviate from this guideline is when null is intentionally
indicating something DIFFERENT from zero items.
			For example, a collection of user names for a website might be null to
		indicate that an up-to-date collection could not be obtained for some reason;
		that is semantically different from an empty collection.

 - DO NOT represent an empty collection with a null reference.
 - CONSIDER using the Enumerable.Empty<T>() method instead.
